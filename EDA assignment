Suppose that you are given a dataset of customer product reviews for an e-commerce company. Each review is scored as a Likert-style 
survey item where 1 indicates a negative sentiment about the product and a 5 is positive. These reviews are collected on the company's
website. a. What problems do you expect to find in the raw data? b. If your task is to build features that give information about 
customer sentiments, how would you approach this task and what kind of methods would you apply to accomplish it?

First ask questions.. What kind of people would be doing the reviewing?
A. We may not get a lot of reviews. We may get either positive or negative reviews and that's potentionally sampling bias.

B. If I am building a feature that gives information about customer setiments, I would create a negative, neutral and positive scale.
Negative will be a red frowny face, neutral will be a yellow chilling facial expression emoji, and positive will be a green smiling emoji.
Customers will choose one of the emojis to represent their satisfactory rate and give a short analysis review afterwards.
